# Dotfiles

## Setup

Clone to a bare git repo.

TODO: write this up better

## Caveats

Git will not bug you about untracked files. **You are responsible for
`git add`ing every file you want to track!**

There are things you probably **do not** want to track.

## About

I'm trying out a different way of managing dotfiles. I call it the
"StreakyCobra" method, after [this HN post][StreakyCobra]. There are other
writeups [[1]][atlassian] [[2]][antelo] about this as well.
